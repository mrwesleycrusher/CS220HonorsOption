CS220 Honors Option Project

This project will be looking at different algorithms for the classic "making change problem". In this problem the computer is given a set of integers which represent respective coin values that the computer can choose from, and a value, which is the amount of money the computer needs to create with the set of coin values. This project will specifically looking into:

The Cashier's Problem, which involves finding the payment with the fewest number of coins.

The Greedy Problem, which provides an incorrect solution to the cashier's problem with specific coin sets.

Dynamic Programming solutions which solve the above problems in as few operations as possible.

Implemented using Python 3.
