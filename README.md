CS220 Honors Option Project

This project will be looking at different algorithms for the classic "making change problem". In this problem the computer is given a set of integers which represent respective coin values that the computer can choose from, and a value, which is the amount of money the computer needs to create with the set of coin values. This project will specifically looking into:

Recursive Algorithm, the simplest way of solving the problem through the use of a tree.

The Greedy Problem, where the computer will get stuck not being able to make the appropriate amount of change because it chooses to use the largest coing value to pay first. I will be focusing on the circumstances when it does and doesn't get stuck.
Dynamic programming solutions for making change problem, not limited to but including Cashier's Algorithm, etc.

3 programs demonstrating these different algorithms and 3 pages of text describing the problem / algorithms issues will be the final complete assignment, with check-in of one program per month (Starting February 26th). Final due date April 26th, 2018.

Implemented using Python 3.
